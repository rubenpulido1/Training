Looking at Visual Studio, I have a brand new console app that doesn't have any code added to it at all. I've already added the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer, .Design, and .Tools NuGet packages.

I have an existing database. Let's assume was created and maintained by my organization's Database Administrator. This database is already populated.

To reverse engineer the database and create my entity model code, I'll start by using the Scaffold-DbContext commandlet. I'm going to pass in the connection string (which can be found in the notes). I'm going to pass in the name of the provider so it knows what type of database to execute the connection string on, and then I'm going to optionally specify output directories for the dbcontext and models.

If you're using the .NET CLI, the command is `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold`. The parameters are similar.

Now that the Scaffold is run, we have a complete working entity model.

Looking at the product entity, it should look pretty similar to the one we created in the last video. One difference you'll note, however, is there are no data annotations describing the behavior of these properties, like the one we used previously for `Price`.

That's because these behaviors are contained in the OnModelCreating method of the database context. This is another way EF Core lets you control the relationship between your entities and the database.

If we'd like to generate an entity model that looks more like the one we created in the previous video, we can do that too. I'll start by deleting this entity model, and I'll run the Scaffold-DbContext command again. This time, I'll add the data annotation flag.

Now the product entity has data attributes that describe the behavior of the properties. The OnModelCreating method in the database context is also much more sparse.

> The other strategy is rescaffolding the entity model whenever the database schema changes. Using this approach, it's important to use partial classes or extension methods to keep business logic separate from scaffolded entities. This ensures that business logic doesn't get overwritten if you re-scaffold the entities. Let's take a look.

I'm going to delete my entity model and re-scaffold. This time, I'm going to generate the models in a subdirectory of the Models directory, I'll specify the namespaces for the generated classes.

Now I can create partial classes in the Models directory to contain my business logic. This way, I can regenerate the entity models without disturbing my business logic.

Let's paste some code into *Program.cs* so we can see the partial class in action.
